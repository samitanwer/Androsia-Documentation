# Androsia
Androsia is a tool written in Java aimed at analysing Android applications to detect last use of StringBuilder objects. Androsia instruments code to clear memory contents of these objects after their last use so that any sensitive information is destroyed and does not appear in a heap dump. As a result, if an application process gets compromised, the attacker would not be able to extract any sensitive information from a dump.

## Built With

* [Soot](https://sable.github.io/soot/) - The framework used for analyzing and transforming Android applications
* [FlowDroid](https://blogs.uni-paderborn.de/sse/tools/flowdroid/) - Tool used to generate callgraph for Android applications
